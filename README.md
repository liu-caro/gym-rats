# Gym Rats
A website that helps you find gym buddies based on their vicinity to motivate people with busy lives to stay committed to going to the gym. Ideally, would be able to implement compatibility in workout goals, gender preferences, and schedule availability.

Project created for first hackathon ever attended. 
Never created an app or website before this project. 
Learned how to use Android App Studio, Android SDKs, HTML & CSS, Web APIs, Javascript, and attempted to use REST APIs.

We were inspired by the difficult challenge that we ourselves have faced of trying to consistently go to the gym on a busy college schedule. We decided that there is a market for this type of website/app and decided to create it to experiment with designing websites or mobile apps with APIs/SDKs.

We used HTML & CSS to build a website. We used the Here.com API by calling Javascript functions inside HTML files.

Built at HackUMass VI.
